# AI-Powered Math Scanner Web App

## Overview
An advanced mathematical expression scanner and solver API inspired by Apple's new iPadOS feature that can scan and solve mathematical problems from handwritten notes. This project uses Google's Gemini AI model to analyze images containing mathematical content and provide detailed solutions.

## üåü Features
- **Mathematical Expression Recognition**: Scans and solves various types of mathematical content from images:
  - Simple arithmetic expressions (e.g., 2 + 3 * 4)
  - Complex equations (e.g., x¬≤ + 2x + 1 = 0)
  - Variable assignments (e.g., x = 4, y = 5)
  - Graphical math problems (geometry, trigonometry)
  - Abstract mathematical concepts through drawings

- **BEMDAS Compliance**: Follows standard mathematical order of operations:
  - **B**rackets
  - **E**xponents
  - **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
  - **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

- **Variable Support**: Handles pre-defined variables for complex calculations
- **Image Processing**: Processes various image formats containing mathematical content
- **Structured Response**: Returns well-formatted JSON responses with expressions and results
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- Node.js & Express.js
- Google Gemini AI API
- Sharp (Image Processing)
- Joi (Request Validation)
